What is Kotlin?
======

Kotlin started with the Android community and solves many problems that exist in Java. It does an excellent job at inheriting the best features of various languages and eliminates a significant amount of the verbosity found in Java. It’s powerful features and 100% interoperability with Java make a very compelling argument as a language replacement.

> Kotlin is a general purpose, open source, statically typed “pragmatic” programming language for the JVM and Android that combines object-oriented and functional programming features. It is focused on interoperability, safety, clarity, and tooling support. Versions of Kotlin for JavaScript (ECMAScript 5.1) and native code (using LLVM) are in the works. - *[What is Kotlin](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3224868/java/what-is-kotlin-the-java-alternative-explained.html)*
