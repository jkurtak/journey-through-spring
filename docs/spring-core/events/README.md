Events
======
The concept of [Events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(computing)) is fundamental to computer programming and allows us to design components with loose coupling and high cohesion. Springâ€™s context is highly event driven and exposes this feature for you to listen and react to events as well as fire your own.

## ApplicationEvent
Spring provides a class called [ApplicationEvent](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationEvent.html) to faciliate the processing of events. Your events do not need to extend this class but it is good practice. Its constructor takes a single argument of type Object which is intended to be the *source* of the event. 

### What are good Events?
An event *source* is the Object for which the event is trigger against. For example, say you want to send an E-Mail to every user that signs up for your system. The event would be something like *UserSignedUpEvent* and the source would be the *User* object.

Events are things that *have happened* and they are past tense. UserLoggedInEvent states that a user has already logged in and you're being notified of the fact. Do not use events in place of direct method invocation, that's not the idea. They are more about a change to the conceptual design of your application and building a set of components that react to each other in a choreographed way.

### Events are POJO's
With the except of extending ApplicationEvent for best practice, the event class it self should just be a plain old java object, nothing fancy, just a wrapper of data. 

```kotlin
// Model of a simple User 
data class User(
        var id: Long = 0L,
        var username: String = "",
        var email: String = ""
)

// Event to be raised when a new user signs up
class UserSignedUpEvent(user: User) : ApplicationEvent(user)
```

### Raising Events with ApplicationEventPublisher
Spring provides a convenient means to raise events with [ApplicationEventPubliser](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationEventPublisher.html). Inject this into any location where you need to raise events and call publish!

```kotlin
@Component
class UserService(
        var userRepo: UserRepository,
        var appEventPublisher: ApplicationEventPublisher){

    /**
      * Creates and saves a new user to the database, after succeeding it will
      * raise the UserSignedUpEvent for other interested components to react. 
      */ 
    fun register(username:String, email:String){
        var user = userRepo.save(User(username, email))
        applicationEventPublisher.publishEvent(UserSignedUpEvent(user))
    }
}
```

### Listening for Events
You can listen for events by either implementing the [ApplicationListener](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationListener.html) interface or by annotation. As always don't forget that you class must be a Bean or else Spring will not have any control over it (here we are defining @Service).

Either approach is fine but the interface implementation makes it a bit more obvious and easier to search on. 

#### ApplicationListener Interface
```kotlin
@Service
class EmailService : ApplicationListener<UserSignedUpEvent> {
    override fun onApplicationEvent(event: UserSignedUpEvent) {
        var user = userSignedUpEvent.source as User
        // send out the email
    }
}
```
#### @EventListener Annotation
```kotlin
@Service
class EmailService {

    @EventListener
    fun sendWelcomeEmail(userSignedUpEvent: UserSignedUpEvent){
        var user = userSignedUpEvent.source as User
        // send out the email
    }

}
```

### Debugging Events
TODO.

## Async Events
TODO.

## Transactionl Events
TODO.

## Domain Events with Spring Data AbstractAggregateRoot
TODO.

## Spring Integration
We cover Spring Integration in another section but it's important to know that it has support for listening to Spring ApplicationEvents with a component called [ApplicationEventListeningMessageProducer](https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/event/inbound/ApplicationEventListeningMessageProducer.html).

* **Read:** [Spring ApplicationEvent Support](https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/applicationevent.html)
TODO - demonstrate.
