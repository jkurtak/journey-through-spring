Events
======
The concept of [Events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(computing)) is fundamental to computer programming and allows us to design components with loose coupling and high cohesion. Springâ€™s context is highly event driven and exposes this feature for you to listen and react to events as well as fire your own.
